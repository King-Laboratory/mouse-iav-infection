That is to say, most forward and reverse reads were successfully paired together. Because we are just trying to map to a reference genome, the read lengths of the forward reads alone, in this case, around 60 million basepairs, should be sufficient.\n",

    "This command prepares a reference genome and annotation files for RNA-Seq analysis using RSEM (RNA-Seq by Expectation-Maximization) and Bowtie. It generates files needed to quantify gene and isoform expression. The rsem-prepare-reference function takes a GTF file with gene annotations (mouse_annotation.gtf) and a FASTA file with the reference genome sequence (mouse_genome.fa). It processes these files to create a reference, saving the output in the mouse_reference directory. The -p $THREADS option sets the number of threads used for parallel processing, speeding up the preparation process."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we covered the following key concepts and workflow steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bulk RNA-seq Preprocessing**: Downloading the full dataset and metadata using the SRA Toolkit and Athena, and setting up directories\n",
    "- **Quality Control**: Use FastQC and MultiQC to assess the quality of reads in the dataset and combine results for all samples to generate a comprehensive overview of quality metrics across multiple samples.\n",
    "- **Adapter Trimming**: Learn how to use Trimmomatic to remove adapter sequences and low-quality bases from FASTQ reads.\n",
    "- **Read Mapping and Quantification**: Understand the purpose of indexing and learn how to use STAR to create an index of the reference genome for efficient read mapping. Map reads to reference genome and quantify gene expression levels using RSEM.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this Jupyter Notebook provided a hands-on demonstration of an extended Bulk RNA-Seq analysis workflow, guiding users through essential steps such as obtaining sequencing data from the Sequence Read Archive using the SRA Toolkit and Athena, read trimming with Trimmomatic, quality control with FastQC and MultiQC, reference genome indexing with STAR, read mapping and quantification using RSEM, and storing data on an AWS S3 bucket. By processing the full set of reads from a mouse dataset, we were able to observe the expression levels of the top 10 most highly expressed genes in each sample. This workflow serves as a foundation for more advanced analyses, and further resources are available for utilizing R/DESeq2 for differential gene expression analysis using the read counts generated in this tutorial, and using NetAct for transcription factor network analysis. Ultimately, this tutorial equips users with the basic skills to analyze RNA-seq data and to understand the core components of a typical RNA-seq pipeline.\n",
